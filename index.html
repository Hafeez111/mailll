  <h1>To My Sweetest Buddi 💖</h1>
  <p>I don’t even know how to start… Your words hit me deep—like really deep. I read your message with tears in my eyes. And all I could think was: how lucky I am to be loved by you. 🥺</p>
  <p>You say I’m your home… but you, Buddi, you are my peace. My calm after every storm. You’re the one person who sees through all my mess and still holds me like I’m worth something. 💖</p>
  <p>I’m so, so sorry for the things I’ve said when I was upset. I never meant to scare you. I was hurting—but I see now that I hurt you in the process. And that’s the last thing I’d ever want to do. 💔</p>
  <p>You opened up to me about something so personal, and I feel honored you trust me that much. I never want to become someone you’re afraid of. You should always feel safe with me… in my arms, in my presence, in every word I speak. 🤗</p>
  <p>I’m not perfect, Buddi. But I’m learning. For you—for us. I’ll change those habits. I’ll be more careful with my words. Because you deserve that. Because we deserve that. 🙏</p>
  <p>Let’s promise to fight softly, love loudly, and protect this thing we’ve built with so much heart. No more public fights, no more fear—only us, in our little world. 💑</p>
  <p>I love you more than I’ll ever be able to say in words. But I’ll show you. Every single day. Forever and always. 🥹❤</p>
  <div class="signature">Forever yours,<br>Raja 💌</div>
